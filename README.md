# On Chain Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Game Logic:

This game consists of 2 players, and a "room" like objecc.

### Create room:
Player 1 will create a room along with a ```commitment```, which is generated by the ```RockPaperScissors.generateCommitment(Move, salt)``` function. ```generateCommitment``` will return a hashed string as ```commitment```. 

```commitment``` is generated with Move, hence the Move from player 1 is included in the hash and unseen by player 2.

Player 1 could now use the ```commitment``` to create a game and invites player 2 to join the game.

The room will now be in ```State=Waiting```.

### Join room:

Algorithm TBD

Player 2 will join the game with its Move. The room will be in ```State = Committed``` 

### Reveal:

Algorithm TBD

After player 2 join the game with a Move, player 1 will be noticed. Player 1 will reveal the Moves and the room will be in ```State = Revealed```

### Final action:

Algorithm TBD

The contract will then perform action to compare the moves and announce the winner. The room will switch to ```State = Completed```
